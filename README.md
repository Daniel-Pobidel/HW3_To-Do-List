Daniel Pobidel CS407 Mobile App Development- Hw3- TO-DO list

This app uses two different activities. The first maintains a to-do list which is used to view and keep
track of tasks. Long press on list items deletes them and user is notified upon all task completion.
Button takes user to second activity, where tasks can be added. There is a button to go back(cancel),
a button to save a task and go back to main activity, and third button to keep adding tasks. Tasks are 
persistent and remember the previously stored tasks upon re-launching app using sharedpreferences.
